# Test Fixes Applied - Round 3

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Test Assertion Names (Class Names)
**Problem**: Tests were using old class names in assertions
- `assert DependencyRiskAnalyzer is not None` 
- `assert CodeForecaster is not None`

**Fix**: Updated to correct class names
- `assert DependencyRisk is not None`
- `assert CodeClimatePredictor is not None`

**Files Modified**: `tests/test_beta_features.py`

---

### 2. ✅ Windows File Cleanup (PermissionError)
**Problem**: `temp_python_file` fixture was causing PermissionError on Windows
```python
# Old code - file still open when trying to delete
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(...) as f:
    yield Path(f.name)  # File still open!
    os.unlink(f.name)   # PermissionError on Windows
```

**Fix**: Close file before yielding and add error handling
```python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(...) as f:
    filename = f.name
# File automatically closed when exiting 'with' block
yield Path(filename)
try:
    os.unlink(filename)
except OSError:
    pass  # Ignore cleanup errors
```

**Files Modified**: `tests/test_beta_features.py` (line 475-505)

---

### 3. ✅ Test Result Structure Assertions
**Problem**: Tests checking for wrong keys in result dictionaries

**Fixes Applied**:
- `test_risk_analysis`: Changed `assert "summary" in result` → `assert "risk_summary" in result`
  - DependencyRisk returns `risk_summary` not `summary`
  
- `test_license_check`: Changed `assert "licenses" in result` → `assert "dependencies" in result`
  - License info is inside dependencies array, not a separate key

**Files Modified**: `tests/test_beta_features.py`

## Commit Details

**Commit**: `3ae12fd`  
**Message**: 🔧 Fix test assertions and Windows file handling  
**Branch**: beta  
**Status**: Pushed to GitHub

---

## GitHub Actions Status

### Previous Run (commit 1645875)
- ❌ 20 errors reported
- ✅ Real repo tests PASSED (Flask, Requests, Pytest - all 12 features)
- ❌ Main test suite failing (test-beta-features jobs)

### Current Run (commit 3ae12fd)
- 🔄 Running now...
- Expected: Main test suite should now pass with fixes applied

---

## Key Insights

### Why Local Tests Fail
Local environment is **missing required dependencies**:
- ❌ GitPython (for git repository analysis)
- ❌ scikit-learn (for ML predictions)
- ❌ numpy (for numerical operations)
- ❌ networkx (for graph analysis)
- ❌ license-expression (for license parsing)

**This is expected!** The beta features require these dependencies, which are:
1. Listed in `pyproject.toml`
2. Auto-installed by GitHub Actions during CI/CD
3. Not installed locally on this machine

### Why Real Repo Tests PASSED
The `test-with-real-repos` jobs successfully tested all 12 features because:
1. GitHub Actions installed all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
2. Real repositories (Flask, Requests, Pytest) have git history
3. All features worked correctly with dependencies installed

## What We Fixed

### Round 1 (Previous Commits)
- ✅ pytest markers
- ✅ Class name refactoring (DependencyRiskAnalyzer → DependencyRisk)
- ✅ Class name refactoring (CodeForecaster → CodeClimatePredictor)
- ✅ Method name corrections (40+ fixes)
- ✅ Workflow repository format

### Round 2 (commit 1645875)
- ✅ SyntaxError at line 317
- ✅ ReviewTutor.conduct_review() signature
- ✅ CrossRepoIntelligence method usage

### Round 3 (commit 3ae12fd) - THIS COMMIT
- ✅ Test assertion variable names
- ✅ Windows file cleanup (PermissionError)
- ✅ Result structure assertions (risk_summary, dependencies)

---

## Expected Outcome

With these fixes, **GitHub Actions should PASS** because:

1. ✅ All import names are correct
2. ✅ All class names match implementations
3. ✅ All method signatures are correct
4. ✅ All assertions check for correct result keys
5. ✅ Windows file handling is robust
6. ✅ Real repo tests already passing (validates feature functionality)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor GitHub Actions** (commit 3ae12fd)
   - Check workflow run in GitHub Actions tab
   - Should complete in ~3-5 minutes

2. **If Tests Pass** ✅
   - Begin beta testing period (1-2 weeks)
   - Gather user feedback
   - Prepare for v0.5.0 stable or v1.0.0

3. **If Tests Still Fail** ❌
   - Review new error logs from GitHub Actions
   - Apply additional targeted fixes
   - Push another commit
