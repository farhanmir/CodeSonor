## 🔄 STEP 4: MERGE TO MAIN (After Testing)

### When Ready
```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge beta
git merge beta

# Resolve any conflicts (shouldn't be any)

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Tag stable release
git tag v0.5.0
git push origin v0.5.0
```

### Update Version
In `src/codesonor/__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml`:
```python
__version__ = "0.5.0"  # Remove -beta
```

---

## 🚀 STEP 5: PUBLISH TO PYPI (After Merge)

### Prerequisites (Do Later)
1. Create PyPI account: https://pypi.org
2. Generate API token
3. Add to GitHub secrets as `PYPI_API_TOKEN`

### Publishing
Once merged to main and tagged `v0.5.0`:

**Option A**: Automatic via GitHub Release
- Create release from `v0.5.0` tag
- GitHub Actions will auto-publish to PyPI

**Option B**: Manual
```bash
pip install build twine
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```
